# 2D Minecwaft

"Terraria is just like 2D Minecraft", they said. And they were <b>wrong</b>.

2D Minecwaft is what the name says. A two-dimensional version of the game "Minecraft". This game is made from scratch and doesn't use any of Minecraft's source code, but is created to represent Minecraft in a 2D environment as well as possible.

<h2>How to use</h2>
<h4>If you don't own Minecraft, you can't play 2D Minecwaft</h4>

To avoid copyright infringement, Minecraft's assets will not be included in any commits. This means you have to have Minecraft on your PC to get the required assets to run the game. Further down the line, 2D Minecwaft will have its own assets so it can be played by anyone.

<h4>Step-by-step guide for usage</h4>

1. Import the project into your IDE.
2. Create a new source folder to the project called "res".
3. Locate the .minecraft folder on your PC. [How?](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft#Locating_.minecraft)
4. Go to the versions folder and select a version at least 1.16. (if you don't have any, launch Minecraft version 1.16 or above)
5. Copy the contents of the assets/minecraft folder into the res folder you created.
6. Add the java-json library to the project.
7. Run the Game class to launch the game.
8. Potential success!

<h2>Future plans</h2>

This project was abandoned after realizing how badly it's made.
Conversion to Godot or LÃ–VE might happen some time in the future.
