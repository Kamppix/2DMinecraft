# What is this?
"Terraria is just like 2D Minecraft", they said. And they were <b>wrong</b>.

I present to you... The <b>true</b> 2D Minecraft!

Made from scratch in Java. Just like the one and only Markus "Notch" Persson made Minecraft.

Feel free to try and understand any of my code as this is my first ever proper java project.

# How to use this?
If you want to play the game, you just need to launch it from your IDE. Simple. Oh, and you might also want to add a source folder called "res" which has Minecraft's assets in it because I will not include Minecraft's assets when committing. (for obvious reasons)
