# What is this?
"Terraria is just like 2D Minecraft", they say. And they are <b>wrong</b>.

I present to you... The <b>true</b> 2D Minecraft!

Made from scratch in Java. Just like the one and only Markus "Notch" Persson made Minecraft.

Feel free to try and understand any of my code as this is my first ever proper java project.
